The program must accept N transactions of a bank account as the input. Each transaction has a
character (+ for credit or - for debit) followed by the amount. The program must print the available
balance at the end of all transactions as the input. Consider the initial available balance as Rs. 1000.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= Amount <= 10^5
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The next N lines contain a character and an integer each separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the available balance at the end of all transactions.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
+ 1000
- 500
+ 1500
+ 300
- 200
Output:
3100
Explanation:
Initially the available balance is 1000 so after all the transactions the available balance is 1000 + 1000 -
500 + 1500 + 300 - 200 = 3100
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
6
+ 200
- 1200
+ 2500
+ 1600
- 900
- 450
Output:
2750

        scanf("%s %d",&ch,&m);
        if(ch[0]=='+')
        {
            res+=m;
        }
        else
        {
            res-=m;
        }
    }
    printf("%d",res);
}
