The program must accept N integers as the input. The program must print only the integers
containing only even digits as the output. If there is no such integer then the program must print -1 as
the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^9
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by space.
Output Format:
The first line contains integers separated by space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
245 62 87 108 24
Output:
62 24
Explanation:
The first integer has both odd and even digits so it is not printed.
The second integer has only even digits so it is printed.
The third integer has both odd and even digits so it is not printed.
The fourth integer has only even digits so it is printed.
The fifth integer has only even digits so it is printed.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4
41 3826 123 921
Output:
-1







Code :

import java.util.*;
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int n=sc.nextInt();
		long[] arr=new long[n];
		int count=0;
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
		    arr[i]=sc.nextLong();
		    long a=arr[i];
		    int cnt=0,c=0;
		    while(a!=0)
		    {
		        long x=a%10;
		        if(x%2==0)
		        {
		            cnt++;
		        }
		        c++;
		        a=a/10;
		    }
		    if(cnt==c)
		    {
		        System.out.print(arr[i]+" ");
		        count++;
		    }
		}
		if(count==0)
		{
		    System.out.println("-1");
		}
