The program must accept a string S and replace each vowel with the previous occurring vowel in S.
Similarly the program must replace each consonant with the previous occurring consonant. The first
occurring vowel or consonant remain unchanged. 
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains the value of S.
Output Format:
The first line contains the modified value of S.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
apple
Output:
apppa
Explanation:
a is a vowel and is the first. So it remains unchanged.
p is a consonant and is the second. So it remains unchanged.
p is then repeated and is a consonant. The previous occurring consonant is p.
l is a consonant and previous occurring vowel is p.
e is a vowel and previous occurring vowel is a.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
manager
Output:
mamanag
