The program must accept marks of N students as the input. There is a team event held in college and
to participate in the event they need to score at least 50. Each team must have exactly 3 students. The
program must print the maximum number of teams that can participate in the event as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 1000
0 <= Marks <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by space.

Output Format:
The first line contains the maximum number of teams that can participate in the event.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
9
50 68 45 78 21 68 98 100 87

Output:
2

Explanation:
There are 7 eligible students but only 6 students can form teams with 3 students each. So the output is
2.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
11
39 47 97 96 44 59 23 32 61 78 24

Output:
1





Code : 

import java.util.*;
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int n=sc.nextInt();
		int[] arr=new int[n];
		int cnt=0;
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
		    arr[i]=sc.nextInt();
		    if(arr[i]>=50)
		    {
		        cnt++;
		    }
		}
		int c=0;
		while(cnt>=3)
		{
		    cnt=cnt-3;
		    c++;
		}
		System.out.println(c);
	}
}
