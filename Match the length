The program must accept N pairs as the input. Each pair contains a string value S followed by an
integer L. The integer in each pair represents the length of a string among N string values. The
program must print all the string values with the position of their length value among the given pairs
as the output.
Note: The length values of N string values are unique.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= Length of S in each pair, L <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains the value of N.
The next N lines each contain the value S and L separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first N lines each contain the string value and an integer separated by a space based on the above
conditions.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4
watch 3
bottle 5
car 4
lion 6
Output:
watch 2
bottle 4
car 1
lion 3
Explanation:
The length of the string watch is 5 which is present in the 2nd pair. So 2 printed.
The length of the string bottle is 6 which is present in the 4th pair. So 4 printed.
The length of the string car is 3 which is present in the 1st pair. So 1 printed.
The length of the string lion is 4 which is present in the 3rd pair. So 3 printed.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
7
PoelzPnF 5
WOXPgh 2
IcmU 7
Lm 9
PUQfE 6

		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
		    String s=str[i];
		    int l=s.length();
		    int index=0;
		    for(int j=0;j<n;j++)
		    {
		        if(l==arr[j])
		        {
		            index=j+1;
		            break;
		        }
		    }
		    System.out.println(s+" "+index);
		}
